# Recipe App with Blog Section

Welcome to the Recipe App with a built-in Blog section! This application allows users to explore, create, and share their favorite recipes.

This project was created as a collaborative effort between a frontend engineer (My Brother) and a backend developer (That's Me!!) â€”providing an avenue for both to work together and create value. This is just the Backend Section, to see the Frotend Section visit [Frotend App](https://github.com/Jamesolujae123/recipeNet/tree/main)
